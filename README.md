A collection of Atelier series related icons that I have converted to SVG. All of this is intended for use on Barrel Wisdom.

I don't own the icons so do what you want with them.

If you zoom in you'll notice lots of imperfections. Yeah, I don't care. The general process is to maybe edit the original image's colors a bit, then trace bitmap in Inkscape and do mild cleanup from there.
